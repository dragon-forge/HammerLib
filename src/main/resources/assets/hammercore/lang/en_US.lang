##MANUAL##

hc.manual_cat.hammercore=Hammer Core

hc.manual_name.hammercore=Hammer Core
hc.manual_text.hammercore=A coremod for any Zeitheron's mod
hc.manual_desc.hammercore=HammerCore provides a very large set of APIs to use, some notable features are: ChunkLoad-API, Tooltip API (makes tiles show their progress / tooltip to both WAILA and The One Probe), Network API (for sending packets stored in NBTTagCompound), Multipart API, Cool Visual Effects and lots of others.

hc.manual_name.wrench=Wrench
hc.manual_text.wrench=Dismantle the damn thing!
hc.manual_desc.wrench=HammerCore adds WrenchAPI to make Zeitheron's mods independent of Buildcraft Wrench API. This item is a simple wrench that applies on tiles that respond to this API.

hc.manual_name.apengu=APengu
hc.manual_text.apengu=A sad story of the past
hc.manual_desc.apengu.1=APengu was once known for developing a lot of good mods in the past (around 2017), and me, of course. His life was enjoyable, he often was updating his mods, implementing new ideas and adding more APIs for me, HammerCore. He was a very intelligent inventor in Minecraft community. One day, hoever, he suddenly saw a big light blue dragon that was flying around, probably lost in the field. He went out and tried to meet with the dragon, taking the large size difference in account. That penguin used his volume booster to make the dragon notice him. §4"Hello, there!"§f he spoke. Yes, the dragon did hear him, and landed on the ground nearby.
hc.manual_desc.apengu.2=The dragon's eyes were orange, meaning that he was very hungry. §b"You are a good snack, lil' penguin!"§f he growled looking at my creator... §4"Wait! I am not a snack! I am a talented developer that works for minecraft community!"§f the penguin screamed, but it was too late. Dragon started to lick APengu, then he kicked him into the air, opened his muzzle, and poor penguin landed in his maw, and was swallowed in one gulp. Then the dragon spoke §b"You should probably let me continue your work as I am very talented, and sorry for not introducing myself, my name's Zeitheron, but I guess it's too late. he-he"§f. The penguin was still alive for a few hours, he was screaming from pain, he tried to escape the beast's stomach, but nothing worked.
hc.manual_desc.apengu.3=And as a result we have now: alas I don't know much about anything else, but that §mbeast§r dragon named Zeitheron did keep his word at least, it turned out that he also loves cold places since he's an ice-type dragon. Though, the old home was quite large for APengu, but as for Zeith, well, it was a perfect fit since he was larger than poor penguin. And yes, the dragon now maintains me, and other mods of APengu, and I guess he's more talented since he did a few mods of his own, that turned out really good, and hey! He uses me, Hammer Core, I'm really happy.

hc.manual_name.zeitheron=Zeitheron
hc.manual_text.zeitheron=An ice dragon
hc.manual_desc.zeitheron.1=After the sad story with APengu, I've got a new owner named Zeith, an ice dragon. He is responsible for all my derps and issues that I may cause to you. Sometimes it gets to that point that I refuse to be fixed at all, and the issues seem impossible to fix. But enough about me, this entry is not about myself! Zeitheron is a very good and cute looking dragon, he is about as tall as two average humans. I should also note that he can change his eye's color when certain things happen. For example, when he's hungry, his eyes turn yellow, when sad - to gray. He has a fish-like light blue fin on his neck and he has ears, which are uncommon, but not rare for dragons.
hc.manual_desc.zeitheron.2=His personallity is caring, he always goes for peaceful ways first and avoids any coflicts. Zeith also enjoys when his belly is being rubbed. If you want to know more about him, you should just meet him, he probably won't eat you, if you don't meet him with orange eyes, I suppose.
